# Simple Gen App using LangChain & FAISS Vector DB

## Overview
This repository contains two applications:

1. **Simple Gen App using LangChain** - A basic AI-powered application leveraging LangChain for text generation.
2. **Simple Gen App using Website Loader, Text Splitting, OpenAI Embeddings, and FAISS Vector DB** - A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) app that loads website content (nhl.com), processes it into embeddings, and retrieves responses using FAISS.

## Key Features
- Utilizes **LangChain** for structured AI interactions.
- Integrates **OpenAI's GPT models** for response generation.
- Implements **website scraping** to extract real-time data.
- Uses **text splitting** techniques for efficient processing.
- Converts content into **OpenAI embeddings** for semantic search.
- Stores and retrieves data using **FAISS Vector Database**.
- Enhances **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** using document chains.
